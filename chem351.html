           <h3>Chemistry</h3>
           <h4>Chem 351 (Organic Chemistry I)</h4>
           <p>Chem 351 is the first semester of BYU's organic chemistry classes. The class covers introductory organic chemistry principles including bonding, structure, reactivity, stereochemistry, NMR and IR, and more. This class is VERY challanging. It is recommended that you join a study group with other students in your class. An in-depth understanding of the material is required to score well on tests. Do not get behind as this class moves very fast and covers a lot of information. One of the best ways to study is to do practice problems. It is a skill that takes time and effort to learn. When doing practice problems, do not rely on the solutions manual. If you get a problem wrong, study WHY you got the problem wrong. Where did you mess up? What principles do you need to review in order to have a complete understanding of the concepts in the unit you are studying? By dedicating yourself to obtaining a deep understanding of the material, you will have sucess in this course.</p>
