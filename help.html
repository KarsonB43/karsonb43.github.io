            <h1>My Path To Med School</h1>
            <u><h1>Extracurriculars</h1></u>
            <p>On this page we will discuss the extracurricular activities you should engage in during your Pre-Med experience. Remember to keep in mind the narritive you are trying to build for your medical school application. If you are trying to build a narrative around your Spanish speaking skills, for example, consider doing volunteering and possible clinical activities that relate to Speaking spanish.</p>
            <h1>Clinical Experience</h1>
            <p>Clinical experience is one of the most important extracurriculars you will do as a Pre-Med. It is a great way to learn if the medical school and becoming a doctor is right for you. There are many different ways to get clinical experience and both volunteer and paid positions count. </p>
            <h1>Volunteering</h1>
            <p>Volunteering shows medical school admissions committees that you are commited to serving your community. This does not have to be related to medicine, but it should be something you are interested in. It is a good idea to get started with this extracurricular early in the Pre-Med process and continue it up until you apply.</p>
            <h1>Shadowing</h1>
            <p>Shadowing is another experience that will help you prove to admissions committies that you know what the daily life of a physician looks like. You should strive to shadow primary care doctors.</p>
            <h1>Research</h1>
            <p>Many medical schools require or highly encourage participation in research of some kind before medical school. This proves that you are familiar with the scientific method and process that lie at the center of modern medicine.</p>
            <h1>Leadership</h1>
            <p>As a physician, you will be a leader. Medical schools like to see engagement in a leadership role during your preparation for medical school. Be creative in your leadership roles. This is another good opportunity to relate an extracurricular to your narrative.</p>
