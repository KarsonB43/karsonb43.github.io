            <h3>MCAT</h3>
            <p>The MCAT is an entrance exam required by both allopathic (MD) and osteopathic (DO) medical schools. </p>
            <div class="MCATsection">
                <h4>MCAT basic structure</h4>
                <p>The MCAT is made up of four sections:</p>
                <p>- Chemical and Physical Foundations of Biological Systems</p>
                <p>- Biological and Biochemical Foundations of Living Systems</p>
                <p>- Psychological, Social, and Biological Foundations of Behavior</p>
                <p>- Critical Analysis and Reasoning Skills (often abbriviated as CARS)</p>
            </div>
            <div class="MCATsection">
                <h4>MCAT Scoring</h4>
                <p>The four sections are scored separately on a scale of 118-132. These four scores are then added together to form the overall test score. Overall scores range from 472-528. The scoring system is convinient because an average score is exactly 500. Pre-Med students should strive to achieve an above average score. Scores are received between four and five weeks of test completion. Most medical schools will accept an MCAT score for three years after completion.

                <h4>When to Take the MCAT</h4>
                <p>Most students choose to take the MCAT during the year before they plan on attending medical school. For most traditional applicants this will be during their junior year of school. It is a good idea to take the test early in the year. If the desired score is not obtained, there is still time to study and take the test again before applying.</p>

            <div class="MCATsection">
                <h4>How to Register</h4>
                <p>Once prepared, visit the AAMC website to register for the MCAT. Before registering, one must create an account and obtain an ID number. Then answer the questions found on the registration website.</p>
